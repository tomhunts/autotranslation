Is this really all there is?

My life would feel meaningful.

But it turns out that wasn't what happened.
但事实却并非如此。

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now, when psychologists talk about meaningfulness in life, what they're talking about is a sense that our lives matter.
现在,当心理学家谈论生活中的意义时, 他们所谈论的就是我们生命的意义。

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That the world makes sense.

That we are more than the sum of our minutes, days, and years on this planet.
我们不仅仅是我们在这个星球上的 时间、时间和年数的总和。

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Now, the research on meaningfulness in life suggests that there are three big ideas associated with meaningfulness in life.
现在,关于生命中有意义的研究 表明,生命中有三个大概念 与生命中的有意义的有关。

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The first big idea is coherence.
第一个大想法是一致性。

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The world needs to feel coherent.
世界需要感到协调一致。

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
After winter comes spring, after spring comes summer, you get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, you have breakfast, you get the kids off,
冬天过后春天,春天过后夏天, 你早上起床,刷牙,吃早餐,让孩子们下车,

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you go to work, those little routines make the world feel noable, predictable.
你去工作,这些小的例行公事 让世界感到无名可言,可以预测

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Coherent.
步调一致

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Now, when you think about personal achievement, it does create sometimes this experience of coherence because we achieve within a framework.
现在,当你考虑个人成就时,它确实有时创造出这种一致性的经验,因为我们在一个框架内实现。

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I understood what they expected of me for 10 years.
我理解他们10年来对我的期望。

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I understood that if I got my papers published, that did well in the classroom, that I talked to the right people, that all the networking, that was a good chance I could tenure.
我理解,如果我的论文出版, 在课堂上做得很好, 我和正确的人交谈, 所有网络, 这是一个很好的机会 我可以使用。

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you're trying to lose weight, you understand.
如果你想减肥,你明白的

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If you change your diet, you exercise.
如果你改变饮食,你运动。

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The weight will come off, or at least we hope so.
重量会下降,至少我们希望如此。

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Now, those things that framework gives the world a sense of coherence.
现在,那些框架赋予世界一种一致性感的东西。

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Second big idea associated with meaningfulness in life, second big idea.
第二个大点子 与生活中的有意义有关,第二个大点子。

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Purpose.

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Purpose.
目的。

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Now, sometimes people use the term purpose as a synonym for meaning in life, and that's not how I mean it here.
有时候人们用这个词来形容生命的意义, 而不是我在这里的意思。

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Purpose is a way of thinking about what your life can be and should be in the future.
目的就是思考你的生活 将来会是什么样的 将来会是什么样的

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's a way of directing your actions.
这是指导你行动的一种方式

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It gives you goals.
它给了你目标。

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
When you get up in the morning, you know what you need to do.
当你早上起床时 你知道你需要做什么

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Here's where the drive for personal achievement is strongest.
这是个人成就最强劲的动力

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's clearest.
这是最清楚的。

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When I was worried about 10 year-end, you were exactly what I need to do when I got up in the morning.
当我担心十岁大的时候 你正是我早上起床时 需要做的

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
When you have a goal, when you're trying to achieve something, you have a clarity about what you should do, how to direct your behavior.
当你有一个目标, 当你试图实现某事, 你清楚你应该做什么, 如何指导你的行为。

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So that's the second big idea is purpose.
所以这是第二个大想法是目的。

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now, the third big idea by many considered to be the most important is significance.
现在,许多人认为最重要的第三个大想法是意义。

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The way I like to think about significance is the sense that you can transcend yourself.
我喜欢思考意义的方式是 感觉你可以超越自己。

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That you are more than what you are right now, but you will continue to matter into the future beyond this moment.
你不只是现在的你, 但你会继续关注未来, 在这个时刻之后。

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is where I think personal achievement falls short.
这就是我认为个人成就不足的地方。

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But definition personal achievement focuses on you.
但定义个人成就的重点放在你身上。

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's a focus on the self.
这是对自我的专注

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If that's all there is, it's difficult to have significance.
如果仅此而已 意义就很难了

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So now I want to think about meaningfulness in life.
所以我现在想思考生活中的意义。

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And significance in particular, it brings to mind a quote attributed to Leonardo da Vinci.
尤其重要的是,它引出了莱昂纳多·达芬奇的引文。

87
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Some of you might know it.
你们中有些人可能知道

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So Leonardo da Vinci was, purported to have said on his deathbed,
So Leonardo da Vinci在临终前说

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I have offended God and mankind because my work did not achieve the quality of life.
我冒犯了上帝和人类,因为我的工作没有达到生活质量。

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Now, I wasn't there.
现在,我不在那里。

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So I don't know if he said that exactly in that way.
所以我不知道他是不是这么说的

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But here's the thing, you can imagine it.
但事情是这样的,你可以想象

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You understand it.
你明白这一点。

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You understand what it means to have even the most glorious achievements and still ask,

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Is this enough?

Is this all I had up to?
这就是我所要做的事吗?

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
When I look back and think about my time, early on in my career,
当我回首往事 思考我的时代 早年我的职业生涯

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I think about when did it feel meaningful?
我想到什么时候感觉有意义了?

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What gave me a sense of meaning?
是什么给了我一种意义感?

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What I think about were my PhD students.
我想到的是我的博士生

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So one of the things that faculty do is train the next generation of faculty.
所以教职员工做的一件事 就是训练下一代教职员工。

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And so you have PhD students and you have them for significant amount of time.
所以,你有博士生 和你有他们 相当长的时间。

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Often, it could be five to six years.

And the relationships are pretty intense.

They go places like Stanford have.

我还是认为我会被炒鱿鱼

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So even with that fear, I'm worried about what do I need to do to make sure Miguel can continue
所以即使有这种恐惧 我也很担心我需要做些什么 确保米格尔能继续

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
in his story and his journey.
他的故事和历程。

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And by the way, he did see.
顺便说一句,他确实看到了。

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He's been great.
他是伟大的。

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He got a job.
他找到了一份工作。

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He's been a professor now for over 15 years at UCLA.
他现在在加州大学洛杉矶分校当教授超过15年了

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He's had serious leadership roles at his university.
他在他的大学里 扮演过严肃的领导角色

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I'm incredibly proud that I got to chance to be a little part of that.
我感到非常自豪 我有机会参与其中

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What does it take from that?
这有什么意义?

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What I take from that is that relationships are what provide us meaning.
我从中得出这样的结论,即关系为我们提供了意义。

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And my guess is you already knew that.
我猜你已经知道了

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm saying something a little bit more than that.
我说的不止这些

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Not just that relationships provide meaning, but the being a part of a story that is not your role.
不仅这种关系提供了意义, 而且是故事的一部分, 而不是你的角色。

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That is not your own provides meaning.
这不是你自己赋予的含义。

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Being a part of a story that is not your own provides meaning.
成为故事的一部分 不是你自己的 提供意义。

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So what does this leave us?
那么,这给我们留下了什么?

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
One, I think personal achievement is great.
第一,我认为个人成就是巨大的。

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I love my personal achievements.
我喜欢我个人的成就。

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm really happy with my life.
我对我的生活真的很满意

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I think it's turned out okay.
我觉得结果还不错

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I wish incredible personal achievements for all of you.
我祝愿大家个人取得令人难以置信的成就。

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So I think that personal achievement is fantastic.
因此,我认为,个人的成就是惊人的。

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:19,000
However, sometimes we replace the deep human need for meaning with chasing of personal achievement.
然而,有时我们用追求个人成就来取代人类对意义的巨大需要。

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And it's a problem when we confuse those two things.
当我们混淆这两件事时,这是个问题。

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And the reason they get confused, the reason it's easy to confuse them is because personal achievement is easy to quantify.
他们困惑的原因 容易混淆的原因是 个人成就很容易量化

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You know if you got that job, you know if you bought that home.
你知道,如果你得到了那份工作, 你知道,如果你买了那家。

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You know how you're with your salary. It's easy to see.
你知道你薪水多高 很容易看出来

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And it's feels comfortable to chase things you understand.
追逐你所理解的事情 感觉很舒服

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And you can achieve. That's one reason.
你可以达到目的,这是原因之一

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The other reason is that personal achievement feels good.
另一个原因是个人成就感觉良好。

167
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Personal achievement feels good.
个人成就感觉良好。

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We want this happiness.
我们希望这种幸福。

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And personal achievement provides a hit of happiness.
个人成就是幸福的一击。

170
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It feels fantastic when you make that person that achievement.
当你让那个人取得成就时 感觉棒极了

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Getting meaning doesn't necessarily feel that way.
获得意义不一定有这种感觉。

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
For example, studies find that parents who spend more time parenting their children, report more meaningful in life,
例如,研究发现,父母为子女做父母的时间越长,其报告在生活中就越有意义,

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
but not necessarily more happiness.
但不一定是更多的快乐。

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So these things are not the same.
所以,这些事情是不一样的。

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So if you want more meaning in life, what is there to do?
所以,如果你想在生活中有更大的意义, 还有什么可以做的呢?

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
One, look for opportunities to participate in other stories.
第一,寻找参与其他故事的机会。

177
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Like a lot of us, you know, it's funny.
就像我们很多人,你知道,这很有趣。

178
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm saying this is outstanding on the stage in the circle.
我的意思是,这是杰出的 在舞台上的圆圈。

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But there's a lot of main character energy I would argue in this room right now.
但我现在在这个房间里 有很多主要的性格能量

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Just fantastic. I love it.
棒极了,我爱死它了

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
However, you might try a little supporting actor energy if you want meaning.
但是,如果你想要意义的话,你可以尝试一点支持演员的能量。

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Play a supporting role in other people's lives.
在他人生活中发挥辅助作用。

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's number one.
这是第一。

184
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Two, except that the pursuit of meaning may not generate happiness.
第二,除了追求意义 可能不会带来幸福。

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:07,000
In fact, it might be uncomfortable that turns out that meaning is more associated with the self-providing for others than providing for you, for yourself.
事实上,也许令人不自在的是 意思更多地与他人的自我供给有关 而不是为您,为您自己提供。

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And that's sometimes a hard thing to do.
有时候这很难做到

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Expending effort, emotional energy on behalf of something that is not going to return happiness is not something that we tend to think of as a useful, a good use of our time.
我们往往认为,为了一些不会带来幸福的东西而付出的巨大努力、情感能量,并不是一个有益、很好地利用我们时代的东西。

188
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But it turns out it does produce meaning.
但事实证明,它确实产生了意义。

189
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So let me say just a couple more things.
所以,让我再说几句话。

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:49,000
One, I think the human need and pursuit of meaning is both beautiful and profound because when you have meaning in your life, that means that someone else gave you the opportunity to participate in the story that is not your own.
第一,我认为人类需要和追求意义是既美丽又深刻的,因为当你在生活中有意义时,这意味着其他人给了你机会,参与不属于你的故事。

191
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And for that, for the meaning you have in your life, you should feel a deep gratitude, a deep gratitude for the people who have allowed you to participate in the story that was not your own.
为此,从你一生的意义来看, 你应该深深的感激, 深深的感激那些 让你参与这个故事的人, 而不是你自己的故事。

192
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,000
On the other side, when you allow people to participate in your life, you're giving them the opportunity to generate meaning.
另一方面,当你允许人们参与你的生活时, 你给他们创造意义的机会。

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And so in that way, the deep human need for meaning connects us in a circle.
因此,通过这种方式, 人类对含义的深刻需求 把我们连接在一个圆圈里。

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I think a beautiful and profound circle of generosity and gratitude.
我认为,慷慨和感激的循环是美丽和深刻的。

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And so right now here, I'm deeply grateful that you all have let me participate in your stories.
所以,现在在这里,我深深地感谢 你们都让我参与你们的故事。

196
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And that's deeply mean for me. Thank you for that.
这对我太刻薄了 谢谢你

197
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The theme of this conference is the brave and the brilliant.
本次会议的主题是勇敢和辉煌。

198
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I think that one way that we can experience or be brave is by accepting the fact that our personal achievements, what we're capable of, what things that we've done, pale, pale, and comparison.
我认为,一个我们可以体验或勇敢的方法 就是接受这样的事实 我们的个人成就,我们的能力, 我们所做的一切, 苍白,苍白, 和比较。

199
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So the effect we have on other people and what that does in the world.
因此,我们对其他人的影响 以及这世界上发生的事情。

200
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And that is you go through the world with all of your brilliance.
那就是你带着你所有的才华 环游世界

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
And that means that in terms of light, as you go through the world, lighting the world, when you interact with other people,
这意味着,从光的角度来看, 当你走遍世界, 照亮世界, 当你与其他人互动,

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and you illuminate them and help them shine more brightly, that's how the world gets illuminated.
你照亮他们,帮助他们更亮亮亮, 这就是世界如何被照亮。

203
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's how we bring up the lights. And the world obviously desperately needs that.
我们就是这样把灯亮起来的 全世界显然急需灯光

204
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And in return, what you get is meaning because when we're gone, all of the accomplishments will mean nothing, the only thing that will be left of you when you're gone.
作为回报,你得到的是意义 因为当我们走了, 所有的成就将毫无意义, 当你离开时,你唯一会留下的东西。

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And we all will be gone eventually. The only thing will be left of you is the role you played in other people's stories.
我们最终都会消失。唯一剩下的就是你在别人的故事中扮演的角色。

206
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What you leave with other people, how that reverberates through time.
你留给别人的东西, 和它如何在时间上回响。

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And that is a beautiful thing, and I wish all of that for you. Thank you.
这是一件美丽的事情,我希望所有这一切都为你。谢谢。
